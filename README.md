# Mailbox Master Detail 

This is the nifty master/detail routing example from the Ember.js homepage
converted to Ember-Cli

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Notes
I converted the straight Ember App to Ember-CLI.  Only did minimal styling
extraction to get app working correctly.

#### Todos
Need to get MomentJS working with Ember-CLI asset pipeline so date helper
can work and show nices dates.  For some reason, momentJS doesn't want to 
integrate properly.   

For a while I have been searching for a nice example of a master detail
interface to base a larger scale project on.  This was a great example from
the folks @ Ember.  Wanted to convert to Ember-CLI for use.  Will be adding
CRUD, http-mocks (removing fixtures) and creating Rails API soon.
